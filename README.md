# Dp-Knapsack
NTU SC2001 Example Class Project
We have a knapsack of capacity weight C (a positive integer) and n types of objects.

## Problem Statement

Each object of the ith type has weight wi and profit pi (all wi and all pi are positive
integers, i = 0, 1, …, n-1). 

There are unlimited supplies of each type of objects.

Find the largest total profit of any set of the objects that fits in the knapsack.

Let P(C) be the maximum profit that can be made by packing objects into the knapsack
of capacity C.

## (1) Give a recursive definition of the function $P(C)$.

$P(C) = max(P(C), P(C-weight[i])+P(i))$, 

$weight[i]<C$

$i:\text{any object available}$

## (2) Draw the subproblem graph for $P(14)$ where n is 3 with the weights and profits given below.
|       | 0   | 1   | 2   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| $W_i$ | 4   | 6   | 8   |
| $P_i$ | 7   | 6   | 9   |


## (3) Give a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the maximum profit, given a knapsack of capacity $C$, $n$ types of objects with weights $W_i$ and profits $P_i$ using the bottom up approach.

The algorithm: 

Since we have unlimited objects for use, a simple $1D$ array can be used instead of a $2D$ array in the original Knapsack problem.

Each element in the array, namely `dp[i]` represents the maximum profit which can be stored in a knapsack of capacity i.

Following the recursive formula, we can construct the botton-up algorithm as following: 

```
    dp[] = int[capacity+1];
    for(every object i){
        for(every capacity j){
            if weight[i] <= j
                dp[j] = max(dp[j], p[i] + dp[j - W[i]])
        }
    }
    return dp[capacity]
```
Time complexity: $Θ((W+1)*N)$. As we can take all items multiple number of times, we check all of them $(1 to N)$ for all weights from $0$ to $W$. Hence, $time complexity = (W+1) * N.$

Space complexity: $Θ(W+1)$. We maintain a dp array of size $W+1$, where $dp[i]$ denotes the maximum profit for capacity $i$. Hence, $space complexity = W+1$

## (4) Code your algorithm in a programming language

### a. show the running result of $P(14)$ with weights and profits given in (2).
### b. Show the running result of $P(14)$ with weights and profits given below. 
|       | 0   | 1   | 2   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| $W_i$ | 5   | 6   | 8   |
| $P_i$ | 7   | 6   | 9   |
